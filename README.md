# Software Engineering Guide: Data Structures, Algorithms, and System Design

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive guide to modern software engineering principles, focusing on data structures, algorithms, and system design. The guide is presented as a single-page web application with a clean and minimalist design, featuring both light and dark themes.

## Features

- **Light and Dark Themes**: Toggle between light and dark themes using the theme switcher button.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Comprehensive Content**: Detailed explanations and examples of common data structures, algorithms, and system design principles.

## Project Structure

```
index.html
styles.css
```

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure and content of the guide.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file containing styles for both light and dark themes.

## Getting Started

To view the guide, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage
